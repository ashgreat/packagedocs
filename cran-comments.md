## Comments

Resubmission:

CRAN comment: "You have not listed Hadley among the authors/copyright holders/contributors."

Response: This was an oversight. We acknowledged in the source but forgot to include it in DESCRIPTION. This has been corrected.

CRAN comment: "Is this (packagedocs suggesting itself) intentional? It's a bit odd, and wasn't there in the previous submission."

Response: This was a mistake and has been corrected.

Also, in previous resubmission, tests were updated to not be platform-specific and should now run on all platforms without issue.
